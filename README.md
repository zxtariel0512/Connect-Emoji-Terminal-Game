# Connectmoji
## Description
An interactive 2-player (computer vs human player) "connection" game.

* the game is played on a vertical grid of cells (imagine a board stood on its side)
* players take alternate turns dropping a piece in a column
* the piece dropped will occupy the lowest unoccupied cell of the grid
* when a player drops a piece that results in an uninterrupted vertical, horizontal or diagonal line of adjacent identical pieces of an agreed upon length, that player wins
* for example, the board below shows that ðŸ˜Ž has won the game by creating a vertical line of four consecutive pieces in column C
